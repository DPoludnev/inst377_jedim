# Title of Project
Market4Farmers: Connecting Farmers To Customers In Need

# Description of Project: 
This project is design to provide members of the public by using Prince George API database  with convenient access to information about Prince George farmer marks 
locations, directions, and operating times.

The website is designed for simple navigation with three main link tabs: about, market and goods.

About is the main page that will display the general purpose of the webpage and will have social media links.

The Markets Link tab will display all the markets within Prince Georges country and will have a gap map along with the search bar for the user’s query.

The Goods link will have further user filter options to narrow down the markets that have specific goods, over all the tabs are meant to narrow down the user’s query and find the right market for them.
